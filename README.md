# Introduction: 

This  Python notebook provid a comprehensive image classification project using TensorFlow. It covers data organization, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model construction, dataset loading, model training with callbacks, feature extraction from a pre-trained VGG16 model, fine-tuning, and evaluation of the fine-tuned model's performance on a test dataset. This script demonstrates a holistic workflow for image classification.
